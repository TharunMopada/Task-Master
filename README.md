# 📋 **TaskMaster – React Native To-Do App**

**TaskMaster** is a productivity-focused **React Native CLI app** (built with **TypeScript**) that helps users manage tasks efficiently. It combines **authentication, task management, filtering, sorting, and prioritization** into a modern mobile experience with support for **light & dark themes**.

---

## 🚀 Why This Project Stands Out

* Demonstrates a **full mobile development workflow** with React Native CLI
* Implements **real-world app features**: authentication, task lifecycle, and productivity tools
* Built with a **scalable architecture**: reusable components, context-based state, modular structure
* Integrates **Firebase Authentication** for secure user management
* Deployed as a **live demo** for instant exploration

---

## ✨ Features

### 🔐 **Authentication**

* Register with email & password
* Login securely with Firebase Authentication

### ✅ **Task Management**

* Add tasks with title, description, start time, deadline, and priority
* Mark tasks as completed
* Delete tasks anytime
* View tasks with status indicators

### 🎨 **UI & UX**

* Light & Dark mode toggle
* Animated statistics cards (Total, Pending, Completed)
* Priority tags for quick glance (Low, Medium, High)
* Clean task cards with responsive layouts
* Friendly empty states & toast notifications

### ⚡ **Advanced Options**

* Sort tasks by **created date, deadline, or priority**
* Filter by **status** (All, Pending, Completed)
* Priority-based task ordering algorithm
* Responsive and user-friendly design

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **React Native CLI (TypeScript)** – robust cross-platform mobile development
* **Firebase Authentication** – secure login & signup
* **React Hooks & Context API** – centralized state management
* **React Native Paper + Custom Components** – UI components and theming
